## 🚀 About

**FreeRTOS** (Real-Time Operating System) is an open-source real-time operating system kernel designed for embedded devices.  
With the ESP32’s dual-core architecture and native FreeRTOS support, it’s the perfect platform to explore multitasking, synchronization, and real-time behavior.

This repository contains the examples for each of the following topics mentioned below-
